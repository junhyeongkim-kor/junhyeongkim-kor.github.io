Over the past several decades, **nanophotonic structures** of subwavelength scale enabled the light-matter interaction with outstanding optical effects. Manifold applications including **sensing, imaging, optical computing, and programmable photonics** can be accomplished in this scheme.

#### Inverse design of nanophotonic devices

#### Nanophotonics assisted by deep learning
